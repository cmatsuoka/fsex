gsex (from Juno-G SysEx) is a small program to send patches to the Roland
Juno-G, written to avoid rebooting to Windows every time I want to upload
patches from a .jgl file to the synthesizer. It is currently Juno-G specific,
but should work with little changes with other Roland devices using the XV
engine such as the XV-5080 or Fantom.


Kernel patch
============

Linux kernels 2.6.21 and earlier (at least) require a patch written by
Alexandre Jousset to properly recognize the Juno-G. See doc/alsa-junog.patch
for further information.


ALSA MIDI client
================

Certain operations require the ALSA MIDI port address where the synthesizer
is connected in client:port format. The address can be obtained using the
"aconnect" utility:

$ aconnect -o
client 14: 'Midi Through' [type=kernel]
    0 'Midi Through Port-0'
client 20: 'Juno-G' [type=kernel]
    0 'Juno-G MIDI 1   '

In this case the address of the Juno-G MIDI port is 20:0 or Juno-G:0


Listing patches from a .jgl file
================================

gsex can be used to list the contents of a .jgl file. To do so, run it
with the -l parameter:

$ gsex -l xv_collection.jgl
File format   : Juno-G librarian file
Num of patches: 1024

Pat#  Cat  Patch name   M/P Part  Waveform 1 Waveform 2 Waveform 3 Waveform 4
----- ---- ------------- -- ----- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
0001  PNO  Standard Pno  P  -2--  (unset)    JD Piano A (unset)    (unset)
0002  PNO  Bright Piano  P  -2--  (unset)    JD Piano A (unset)    (unset)
0003  PNO  Classique     P  12--  Ac.Pno f A JD Piano A (unset)    (unset)

0005  PNO  Piano Thang   P  123-  JD Piano A MKS Piano  JD Piano A (unset)
...


Sending a patch via SysEx
=========================

You can send a patch from a .jgl file to the Juno-G using the -s parameter:

$ gsex -a 20:0 -s 538 xv_collection.jgl
Checking jgl file... ok
Send to MIDI address 20:0
Send patch 0538: PhazeWahClav (KEY)
