gsex (from Juno-G SysEx) is a small program to send patches to the Roland
Juno-G, written to avoid rebooting to Windows every time I want to upload
patches from a .jgl file to the synthesizer. It is currently Juno-G specific,
but should work with little changes with other Roland devices using the XV
engine such as the XV-5080 or Fantom.
